# BMP Util üì∑

# Explanation

BMP_UTIL is a tool which helps to generate images üì∑ in bmp format.
It is also possible to read in data from bitmap formatted files.
<br>
Possibilities

- Generate bmp file code
- Export bmp file
- Read bmp file

# Getting started

<h2 id="getting_started_writing">Writing</h2>

For writing files to the internal filesystem, the util es generating
a header with the provided pixel-data. Providing a filepath is necessary
for a correct output of the .bmp file. Standard is provided in [standard header format](#standard-header-format).
For a custom header, you need to provide a header customized to your liking.
Keep in mind, that a custom header may not work, when specified incorrect.
When providing the standard pixel-vector, there shouldn't be any errors.

‚ùóÔ∏èThe File is getting written from the bottom left corner to the 
top right corner according to the index of the vector list.‚ùóÔ∏è

<h2 id="getting_started_reading">Reading</h2>
For reading you need to provide the filepath. The output will be saved into a given
reference from the user about the vector for the pixels and the header. 
When the method is done, you can use the two datastructures.

# Usage

---

<h2 id="usage_writing">Writing</h2>
For writing simple Pixels without any adaptation of the header.
```c++
//Give the width and height for the image
const uint32_t width = 16;
const uint32_t height = 16;

//Generate a vector of pixels. The Pixel is rgb values
std::vector<BMP::Pixel> pixelData(width * height, {0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF});

//For a red dot in the picture
pixelData[136].green = 0;
pixelData[136].blue = 0;

//Then call the method for generating the image data
BMP::ImageData data = BMP::Generator::generate(width, height, pixelData);

//For outputting the data call
```
//TODO write

# Standard header format

This is the standard header format, when you just provide the pixel vector
and the filepath. Every `-` is generated based on the vector pass to the generator.
